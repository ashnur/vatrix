#**UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT. NOT FINISHED and NOT USABLE** (yet :)

vectors, matrices and vatrices. :D


inspiration [WildLinAlg26: Change of basis and Taylor coefficient vectors](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz41Ut-ffJ0)

## Why
There isn't a good, performant vectorn, matrixn library for javascript. And I need it.

## Example

### vatrix

```javascript
var vatrix = require('vatrix')

```

For more examples, see tests/vatrix-test.js.

## Install

### npm

```bash
npm install vatrix
```

### browser

Download src/delve.js, and include it as a script tag.
